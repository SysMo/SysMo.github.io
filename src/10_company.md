# SysMo

For over 10 years SysMo has been working on developing tools and models for engineers to solve complex problems. We have built system models for simulating hydrogen production, storage and use in the mobility sector and we evaluate performance of components and systems under realistic scenarios. We have developed software systems for collecting clinical trial "big data" based on millions of biomarkers and analyzing it using machine learning for developing more effective cancer treatment. We tackle the problem of balancing the energy grids in order to allow intermittent renewable sources like wind and photovoltaics to replace fossil fuels and mitigate climate change. We strive to improve our skills every day, and we would love to find motivated students who wish to learn the art and science of physical modeling, data analysis and software development.
